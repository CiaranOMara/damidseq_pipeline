[v1.2]
*  Completely re-written normalisation routine based on kernel density estimation
*  Genomic coverage is now calculated internally rather than using bedtools (uses much less memory, is slightly faster, and drops the requirement for an external binned windows file)
*  Binned window files are no longer required (bins are calculated automatically using the sequence information provided in the BAM headers, and the bin size specified by the --bins command-line option)
*  Better handling of GATC fragment files (should prevent hangs/pauses when creating GATC fragment arrays)
*  Added ability to process BAM files directly
*  Much better file-handling all round (now takes sample names directly from filenames by default; the option to use an index.txt file remains but is essentially deprecated)
*  Re-written --help output rountines (better formatted and more informative)
*  Ability to save sets of defaults to enable quick switching between different genomes  (use --save_defaults=[name]; use --load_defaults=[name] to load; use load_defaults=list to list current available options)
*  New location for config files (in ~/.config/damid_pipeline/).  Existing config file will be migrated automatically
*  Various small bugfixes and code clean-ups

** NB: a number of default parameters have changed with this release.  It is strongly advised to reset all parameters to the default value with --reset_defaults.
